Cryogels, due to their inherent interconnected porosity, mimic the capillary network of hollow fibre bioreactors (the most clinically accepted bioreactor design for BAL devices), providing a large surface area-to-volume ratio for the immobilization and culture of a large number of hepatocytes in a small volume21. Poly(NiPAAm)-chitosan cryogel continuous bioreactors showed the ability to maintain functionality of hepatocytes as well as detoxify circulating plasma obtained from ACLF patients20. In this paper, a hybrid cryogel based bioreactor was designed that integrates separate bioreactor module, plasma separation module and activated charcoal module of conventional BAL setups into one compact device so as to improve the efficacy of the bioreactor and reduce the amount of blood withdrawn for circulation",

In contrast, a recently described approach circumvents some of these issues by implanting human ectopic artificial livers (HEALs) in mice without host liver injury in a low-cost, rapid, and scalable fashion22. These poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based HEALs leveraged classical hepatic tissue engineering techniques to stabilize primary human hepatocyte function prior to and after implantation, such as introducing an appropri- ate supportive coculture cell type23,24 and promoting three-dimensional (3D) hepatic spheroid formation2528. As a result, tissue-engineered HEALs not only sustained primary human hepatocyte survival and function in three dimensions (3D), but also engrafted after ectopic implantation in vivo, allowing the facile modeling of human-specific drug metabolism in a mouse22. However, first-generation HEALs were fabricated using a polymer with nanometer pore sizes and thus may not support infection by micron-sized hepatotropic pathogens such as Plasmodium sporozoites",
