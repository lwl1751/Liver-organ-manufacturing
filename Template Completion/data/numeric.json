Given that current antifibrotic therapy is ineffective, understanding the mechanisms of liver fibrosis is crucial to identify new therapeutic targets. Upon liver damage, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are mainly responsible for the progression of liver fibrosis by transforming their characteristics from a quiescent to an activated state, leading to the excessive production of extracellular matrix (ECM) and formation of a fibrous scar.",
