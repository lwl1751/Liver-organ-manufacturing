# Candidate Generation

Identify possible entity sets from literature sentences to serve as candidates for the next stage. We compared three models: GPT-4o-mini, GLM-4-Chat and LLaMA3-8B-Instruct. The latter two models were fine-tuned on the training set.

# Template Completion

We compared our structured template completion pipeline with a direct extraction approach using GPT-4o-mini.
